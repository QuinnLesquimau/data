Let $\sigma(\mathcal{U}, n)$ be a winning Markov strategy for $F$ in the Menger
game, and $\mathfrak{C}$ collect all open covers of $X$. Then for
\[
  R_n = \bigcap_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathfrak{C}} \bigcup\sigma(\mathcal{U},n)
\]
it follows that $R_n$ is relatively compact to $X$, and
$\bigcup_{n<\omega} R_n = X$.
