Let \(f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be continuous. Since for all \(a,b\in f(X)\),
\(f^{-1}(a)\) and \(f^{-1}(b)\) are closed subsets of \(X\) and thus cannot
be disjoint, it follows that \(a=b\), making \(f\) constant.

Page 23 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} points out the lack of multiple
closed singletons, forcing continuous maps from an ultraconnected space
to any \(T_1\) space to be constant.
