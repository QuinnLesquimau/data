Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a $\sigma$-locally finite base. For each $x \in X$, there is a neighborhood $N_x$ meeting countably many members of $\mathcal{V}$. If $X$ is weakly Lindel√∂f, there is a countable $\{N_i\}$ which covers a dense subset of $X$. Then $\mathcal{U} = \{ V \in \mathcal{V}\ |\ N_i \cap V \neq \emptyset\}$ is a countable basis for $X$.
