Let $x$ be a point in $X$. By local compactness there is a compact neighbourhood $K$ of $x$. By the definition of the word neighbourhood there is an open set $U$ such that $x\in U \subseteq K$. The closure of $U$ is contained in the closure of $K$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, $K$ is closed, therefore the closure of $U$ is contained in a compact set $K$ and therefore compact itself.
