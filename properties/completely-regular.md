A completely regular space is one in which points and closed sets can be separated by a function.

In other words, a space is completely regular if, given a closed set $A$ and a point $b \notin A$, there is a continuous function $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f(A) = \{0\}$ and $f(b)=1$.

Defined on page 14 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} (as \(T_{3.5}\).
