A cover $\{V_{\beta}\}$ of $X$ is a star refinement of another cover $\{U_{\alpha}\}$ of $X$ if for every $x \in X$ there is some $U_{\alpha}$ such that $\cup \{V_{\beta}\,|\,x \in V_{\beta}\} \subset U_{\alpha}$.

A space is fully normal if every open cover has an open star refinement.

(Note that some authors swap the definitions of fully normal and fully \(T_4\).)
