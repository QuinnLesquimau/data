A completely normal space is one for which any subspace is normal (under the subspace topology).

Equivalently, a space is completely normal provided any two separated sets can be placed into disjoint open sets.

(Two sets $A$ and $B$ are separated whenever $\operatorname{cl}(A) \cap B = A \cap \operatorname{cl}(B) = \emptyset$.)
