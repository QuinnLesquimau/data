A topological space is a $k_\omega$ space if there is an increasing sequence of compact Hausdorff subsets $K_1\subseteq K_2 \subseteq K_3 \subseteq \cdots$ such that the topology on $X$ is final with respect to the subsets $(K_n)_n$.

Note that there is already a property called $k_\omega$ in the database but since the name contains a formula you cannot use it for Theorems.
