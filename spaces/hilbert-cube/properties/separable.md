The set $D = \{(q_0,\ldots,q_n,0,0,\ldots,0,\ldots)\mid n \in \mathbb{N}, \forall_{i \le n} q_i \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ is countable (as a union of countable sets that are equinumerous to $\mathbb{Q}^n$ for all finite $n$...) and dense, as baisc product open sets only depend on finitely many coordinates.
