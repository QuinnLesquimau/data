The set $\mathbb{R} \setminus D$ of irrational numbers is closed. Suppose $U$ is an open neighborhood of some fixed rational number $r$, and $V \supseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus D$ is open. Then there is a $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $( r - \varepsilon , r + \varepsilon ) \cap D \subseteq U$, and picking any irrational number $p \in ( r - \varepsilon , r + \varepsilon )$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $( p - \delta , p + \delta ) \subseteq V$. Then $( r - \varepsilon , r + \varepsilon ) \cap ( p - \delta , p + \delta )$ is a nonempty open interval, and any rational number it contains belongs to both $U$ and $V$.
