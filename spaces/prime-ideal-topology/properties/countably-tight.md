[[Proof]]

* [T000135] [Second Countable|P000027]
* [I000185] [sequential|P000079] => [countably tight|P000081]
* [I000184] [Fréchet Urysohn|P000080] => [sequential|P000079]
* [I000183] [First Countable|P000028] => [Fréchet Urysohn|P000080]
* [I000125] [Second Countable|P000027] => ([Lindelof|P000018] + [First Countable|P000028] + [Separable|P000026])
