Consider the subset $A:=(\mathbb R \setminus \{0\})^\omega \subseteq \mathbb R^\omega$ and the point $p:=0\in\mathbb R^\omega$. Since every $0$-neighorhood contains a point in $A$, we have that $p\in\overline A$.

However, there is no sequence in $A$ converging to $p$. Hence, $\mathbb R^\omega$ with the box topology is not Fréchet Urysohn.
