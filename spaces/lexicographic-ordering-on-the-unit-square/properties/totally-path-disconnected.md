Fix any point $p\in [0,1]$.  Then the map $f:[0,1]\to [0,1]\times [0,1]$ given by $f(t)=(p,t)$ is a non-constant path in the lexicographic square.

Furthermore, it can be asserted that the path components of the lexicographic square are precisely sets of the form $p\times [0,1]$ for any $p\in [0,1]$.  This is because given any two points $(p,q)$ and $(p^\prime, q^\prime)$ with $p < p^\prime$, there exists an uncountable collection of disjoint open sets on the interval from $(p,q)$ to $(p^\prime, q^\prime)$.
