The origin does not have a compact neighborhood.  Indeed, let $U$ be a neighborhood of $(0,0)$.  Then there is  $B((0,0),\varepsilon)\subset U$.  The collection $\mathcal{A} = \{\{x\}\mid x\in U\setminus B((0,0),\varepsilon\}\cup \{B((0,0),\varepsilon\}$ is an open covering of $U$ with infinitely many elements and no proper subcollection covers $U$.
