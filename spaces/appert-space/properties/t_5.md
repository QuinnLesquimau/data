Every space $X$ with a single non-isolated point $p$ is normal. Because if $A, B$ are disjoint and closed, and none contains $p$, they are already open and disjoint. Otherwise exactly one contains $p$, say $A$ does. Then $X \setminus B$ and $B$ are both open and the required disjoint neighbourhoods of $A$ and $B$. 

As every subspace of such an $X$ has the same property, $X$ is also hereditarily normal. As $X$ is trivially $T_1$, Appert space is $T_5$.
