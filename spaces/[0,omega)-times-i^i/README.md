$\Omega$ denotes the first uncountable ordinal and $I$ the unit interval $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$. This space is the product topology on the order space $[0, \Omega)$ crossed with the product space $I^I$.

Other notation for this space is $\omega_1\times I^{c}$, where $c$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum.  $\omega_1$ is alternate notation for the first uncountable ordinal, and an ordinal number by definition is a well-ordered set that contains as its members all ordinals that precede it, hence $[0,\omega_1)=\omega_1$.
