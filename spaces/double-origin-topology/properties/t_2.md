For any points $x , y$ other than 0 and 0* there are neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ separating $x$ and $y$ because $\mathbb R^2$ is $T_2$ under the standard topology.  For $x = 0$ and $y = 0^*$,
$$
U = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb R : x^2 + y^2 < 1, y > 0 \} \cap \{ 0 \} \quad \text{and} \quad V = \{ ( x,  y) \in \mathbb R : x^2 + y^2 > 1, y > 0 \} \cap \{ 0^* \}
$$
are open sets that separate $x$ and $y$.
