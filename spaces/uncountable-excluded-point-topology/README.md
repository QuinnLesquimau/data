Let $X=\omega_1$ be the set of all countable ordinals (therefore having
the cardinality of the least uncountable cardinal).  A set is open in this
topology if it excludes a particular point $0$ or is the whole space.

Considered as #15 ("Uncountable Excluded Point Topology")
in {{doi:10.1007\/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}.
