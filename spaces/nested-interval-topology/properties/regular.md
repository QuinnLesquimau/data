Observe that we wish to prove that given any closed set and a point not in the closed set that there aren't any two disjoint open sets one containing the point and the other containing the closed set. Note that the Nested Interval Topology is hyper-connected thus there are no disjoint open sets, therefore the Nested Interval Topology is not regular.
