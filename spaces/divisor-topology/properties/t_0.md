To show the Divisor Topology is $T_0$, we must show that for every $x,y\in X$, there is an open set $U$ (we will show that there exists a basic open set $B_n$) that contains $x$ but not $y$. To begin, let $x,y\in X$. Without loss of generality, assume $x<y$. Note that since $x<y$, $y$ cannot divide $x$. It follows that $y\notin B_x$. Because $x\in B_x$, the set $B_x$ contains $x$ but not $y$ for all $x,y\in X$ Thus, the Divisor Topology is $T_0$.
