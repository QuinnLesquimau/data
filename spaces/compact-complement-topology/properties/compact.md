Let $A$ be an open cover of $\mathbb{R}$. In other words, $\mathbb{R}$ is a subset of the union of the elements of $A$. Let $U \in A$. Since we know it is open, then its complement is compact by definition of a topology. We want to show there is a subcover, or finite union of elements of $A$ that also contain $\mathbb{R}$. Since each $U$ has a finite number of open sets that cover $\mathbb{R} / U$, then there must exist a finite number of $U$ whose union contains $\mathbb{R}$. (This is the def of subcover implying compactness). 


Did I actually prove this... IDK.
