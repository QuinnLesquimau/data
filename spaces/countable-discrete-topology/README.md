[[Proof of Topology]]
1) $U=\emptyset$ is open by definition. Let $U = X$ is open by definition. 

2) Let $A$ be an arbitrary union of the elements of any subcollection of $\tau$. Since every element in the subcollection are subsets of $X$ their union must be a subset of $X$. Thus, $A$ is a subset of $X$ and is open by definition. 

3) Let $A$ be a finite intersection of elements from any subcollection of $\tau$. Since every element in the subcollection are subsets of $X$ their intersection must necessarily be a subset of $X$. Thus, $A$ is a subset of $X$ and is open by definition.
