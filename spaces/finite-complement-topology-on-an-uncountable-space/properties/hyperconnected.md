Let $\tau$ denote the Finite Complement Topology on an Uncountable Space. Let us be given any two open sets $U_i,U_n \in \tau$. Note that $U_i$ and $U_n$ are uncountable, since they both miss finitely many things. Let $U_j = U_i \cap U_n $ thus by definition $U_j = X - (U_i {}^c \cup U_n {}^c)$. Note that $U_i {}^c \cup U_n {}^c$ is finite since it is a finite union of finite sets, therefore $U_j$ is open. Thus $U_i$ and $U_n$ have uncountably many thins in common thus they are not disjoint, hence $\tau$ is hyper-connected.
